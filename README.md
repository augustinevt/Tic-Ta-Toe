#### Iconographic Tic-Tac-Toe with JQUERY, May 31st, 2016

#### By August von Trapp and Wolfgang Warneke

## Description

This interactive browser-based Tic-Tac-Toe uses Bootstrap glyphicons to play a rousing game of X's and EYES, rather than the traditional X's and O's.  Once the user(s) has initiated the game, (s)he will single-click to place an X and double-click to place an EYE.  Three in a row wins the game.  Congratulations.

Future features may include a congratulations pop-up for a win and a draw pop-up for a "cats' game."
